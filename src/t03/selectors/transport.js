    mixelm: <div>Integer flag for the advection solution option.
        <ul>
            <li><i>MIXELM</i> = 0 standard finite difference method with upstream
                or central-in-space weighting, depending on the value
                of NADVFD
            </li>
            <li><i>MIXELM</i> = 1 Forward-tracking method of characteristics (MOC)</li>
            <li><i>MIXELM</i> = 2 Backward-tracking modified method of characteristics (MMOC)</li>
            <li><i>MIXELM</i> = 3 Hybrid method of characteristics (HMOC) with MOC or MMOC automatically and
                dynamically selected.
            </li>
            <li><i>MIXELM</i> = -1 third-order TVD scheme (ULTIMATE)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>,
    percel: <div>Courant number, i.e., the number of cells (or a fraction of a cell) advection will be allowed in any
        direction in one transport step.<br/>For implicit finite-difference or particle tracking based schemes, there is
        no limit on PERCEL, but for accuracy reasons, it is generally not set much greater than one. Note, however,
        that the PERCEL limit is checked over the entire model grid. Thus, even if PERCEL > 1, advection may not be more
        than one cell’s length at most model locations.<br/><br/>For the explicit finite-difference or the third-order
        TVD scheme, PERCEL is also a stability constraint, which must not exceed one and will be automatically reset to
        one if a value greater than one is specified.</div>,
    nadvfd: <div>is an integer flag indicating which weighting scheme should be used. It is needed only when the
        advection term is solved using the implicit finite-difference method.
        <ul>
            <li><i>NADVFD</i> = 0 or 1 Upstream weighting (default)</li>
            <li><i>NADVFD</i> = 2 Central-in-space weighting</li>
        </ul>
    </div>,
    mxpart: <div>Maximum total number of moving particles allowed, and is used only when MIXELM = 1 or 3.</div>,
    itrack: <div>Flag indicating which particle tracking algorithm is selected for the Eulerian-Lagrangian methods.
        <ul>
            <li><i>ITRACK</i> = 1 First-order Euler algorithm is used.</li>
            <li><i>ITRACK</i> = 2 Fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm is used. This option is computationally demanding
                and may be needed only when PERCEL is set greater than one.
            </li>
            <li><i>ITRACK</i> = 3 Hybrid 1st and 4th order algorithm is used. The Runge-Kutta algorithm is used in
                sink/source cells and the cells next to sinks/sources while the Euler algorithm is used elsewhere.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>,
    wd: <div>Concentration weighting factor between 0.5 and 1. It is used for operator splitting in the particle
        tracking based methods. The value of 0.5 is generally adequate. The value of WD may be adjusted to achieve
        better mass balance. Generally, it can be increased toward 1.0 as advection becomes more dominant.</div>,
    dceps: <div>Small Relative Cell Concentration Gradient below which advective transport is considered negligible.
        A value around 10^-5 is generally adequate.</div>,
    nplane: <div>Flag indicating whether the random or fixed pattern is selected for initial placement of moving
        particles.
        <ul>
            <li><i>NPLANE</i> = 0 Random pattern is selected for initial placement. Particles are distributed randomly
                in both the horizontal and vertical directions by calling a random number generator. This option is
                usually preferred and leads to smaller mass balance discrepancy in nonuniform or diverging/converging
                flow fields.
            </li>
            <li><i>NPLANE</i> > 0 Fixed pattern is selected for initial placement. The value of NPLANE serves as the
                number of vertical “planes” on which initial particles are placed within each cell block. The fixed
                pattern may work better than the random pattern only in relatively uniform flow fields. For two
                dimensional simulations in plan view, set NPLANE = 1. For cross sectional or three-dimensional
                simulations, NPLANE = 2 is normally adequate. Increase NPLANE if more resolution in the vertical
                direction is desired.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>,
    npl: <div>Number of initial particles per cell to be placed at cells where the Relative Cell Concentration Gradient
        is less than or equal to DCEPS. Generally, NPL can be set to zero since advection is considered insignificant
        when the Relative Cell Concentration Gradient is less than or equal to DCEPS. Setting NPL equal to NPH causes a
        uniform number of particles to be placed in every cell over the entire grid (i.e., the uniform approach).</div>,
    nph: <div>Number of initial particles per cell to be placed at cells where the Relative Cell Concentration Gradient
        is greater than DCEPS. The selection of NPH depends on the nature of the flow field and also the computer memory
        limitation. Generally, use a smaller number in relatively uniform flow fields and a larger number in relatively
        nonuniform flow fields. However, values exceeding 16 in twodimensional simulation or 32 in three-dimensional
        simulation are rarely necessary. If the random pattern is chosen, NPH particles are randomly distributed within
        the cell block. If the fixed pattern is chosen, NPH is divided by NPLANE to yield the number of particles to be
        placed per vertical plane.</div>,
    npmin: <div>Minimum number of particles allowed per cell. If the number of particles in a cell at the end of a
        transport step is fewer than NPMIN, new particles are inserted into that cell to maintain a sufficient number of
        particles. NPMIN can be set to zero in relatively uniform flow fields, and a number greater than zero in
        diverging/converging flow fields. Generally, a value between zero and four is adequate. </div>,
    npmax: <div>Maximum number of particles allowed per cell. If the number of particles in a cell exceeds NPMAX, all
        particles are removed from that cell and replaced by a new set of particles equal to NPH to maintain mass
        balance. Generally, NPMAX can be set to approximately twice of NPH.</div>,
    nlsink: <div>Flag indicating whether the random or fixed pattern is selected for initial placement of particles to
        approximate sink cells in the MMOC scheme. The convention is the same as that for NPLANE. It is generally
        adequate to set NLSINK equivalent to NPLANE.</div>,
    npsink: <div>Number of particles used to approximate sink cells in the MMOC scheme. The convention is the same as
        that for NPH. It is generally adequate to set NPSINK equivalent to NPH.</div>,
    dchmoc: <div>Critical Relative Concentration Gradient for controlling the selective use of either MOC or MMOC in the
        HMOC solution scheme.<br/>The MOC solution is selected at cells where the Relative Concentration Gradient is
        greater than DCHMOC.<br/>The MMOC solution is selected at cells where the Relative Concentration Gradient is
        less than or equal to DCHMOC.</div>,
    // BTN
    ncomp: <div>Total number of chemical species included in the current simulation. For single-species simulation, set
        <i>NCOMP</i> = 1.</div>,
    mcomp: <div>Total number of “mobile” species, must be equal to or less than NCOMP. For single-species simulation,
        set <i>MCOMP</i> = 1.</div>,
    prsity: <div>“Effective” porosity of the porous medium in a single porosity system. Note that if a dual porosity
        system is simulated, <i>PRSITY</i> should be specified as the “mobile” porosity, i.e., the ratio of
        interconnected pore
        spaces filled with mobile waters over the bulk volume of the porous medium.</div>,
    icbund: <div>Boundary condition type shared by all species.
        <ul>
            <li><i>ICBUND</i> = 0 inactive concentration cell for all species</li>
            <li><i>ICBUND</i> {"<"} 0 constant concentration cell for all species</li>
            <li><i>ICBUND</i> {">"} 0 active (variable) concentration cell where the concentration will be calculated
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>,
    sconc: <div>Starting concentration (initial condition) at the beginning of the simulation (unit: ML-3).</div>,
    cinact: <div>Value for indicating an inactive concentration cell (<i>ICBUND</i> = 0). Even if it is not anticipated
        to have
        inactive cells in the model, a value for <i>CINACT</i> still must be submitted.</div>,
    thkmin: <div>Minimum saturated thickness in a cell, expressed as the decimal fraction of the model layer thickness,
        below which the cell is considered inactive. The default value is 0.01 (i.e., 1% of the model layer
        thickness).</div>,
    ifmtcn: <div>Flag indicating whether the calculated concentration should be printed to the standard output text file
        and also serves as a printing-format code if it is printed <ul>
            <li><i>IFMTCN</i> {">"} 0 concentration is printed in the wrap form</li>
            <li><i>IFMTCN</i> {"<"} 0 concentration is printed in the strip form</li>
            <li><i>IFMTCN</i> = 0 concentration is not printed</li>
        </ul></div>,
    ifmtnp: <div>Flag indicating whether the number of particles in each cell (integers) should be printed and also
        serves as a printing-format code if they are printed. The convention is the same as that used for <i>IFMTCN</i>.
    </div>,
    ifmtrf: <div>Flag indicating whether the model-calculated retardation factor should be printed and also serves as a
        printing-format code if it is printed. The convention is the same as that used for <i>IFMTCN</i>.</div>,
    ifmtdp: <div>Flag indicating whether the model-calculated, distance weighted dispersion coefficient should be
        printed and also serves as a printing-format code if it is printed. The convention is the same as that
        used for <i>IFMTCN</i>.</div>,
    nprs: <div>Flag indicating the frequency of the output, and also indicating whether the output frequency is
        specified in terms of total elapsed simulation time or the transport step number. Note that what are
        actually printed or saved is controlled by the input values entered in the preceding record. <ul>
            <li><i>NPRS</i> {">"} 0 simulation results will be printed to the standard output text file</li>
            <li><i>NPRS</i> {"<"} 0 simulation results will be printed or saved whenever the number of transport
                steps is an even multiple of NPRS
            </li>
            <li><i>NPRS</i> = 0 simulation results will not be printed or saved except at the end of simulation</li>
        </ul></div>,
    nprobs: <div>Integer indicating how frequently the concentration at the specified observation points should be
        saved in the observation file. Concentrations are saved every NPROBS step.</div>,
    nprmas: <div>Integer indicating how frequently the mass budget information should be saved in the mass balance
        summary file. Mass budget information is saved every NPRMAS step.</div>,
    dt0: <div>Transport stepsize within each time step of the flow solution. DT0 is interpreted differently depending on
        whether the solution option chosen is explicit or implicit:
        <ul>
            <li>For explicit solutions (i.e., the GCG solver
                is not used), the program will always calculate a maximum transport stepsize which meets the various
                stability criteria. Setting DT0 to zero causes the model calculated transport stepsize to be used in the
                simulation. However, the model-calculated DT0 may not always be optimal. In this situation, DT0 should
                be
                adjusted to find a value that leads to the best results. If DT0 is given a value greater than the
                model-calculated stepsize, the model-calculated stepsize, instead of the user-specified value, will be
                used
                in the simulation.
            </li>
            <li>For implicit solutions (i.e., the GCG solver is used), DT0 is the initial
                transport stepsize. If it is specified as zero, the model-calculated value of DT0, based on the
                user-specified Courant number in the Advection Package, will be used. The subsequent transport stepsize
                may
                increase or remain constant depending on the user specified transport stepsize multiplier TTSMULT and
                the
                solution scheme for the advection term.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>,
    mxstrn: <div>Maximum number of transport steps allowed within one time step of the flow solution. If the number of
        transport steps within a flow time step exceeds MXSTRN, the simulation is terminated. </div>,
    ttsmult: <div>Multiplier for successive transport steps within a flow time step, if the Generalized Conjugate
        Gradient (GCG) solver is used and the solution option for the advection term is the standard finite difference
        method. A value between 1.0 and 2.0 is generally adequate. If the GCG package is not used, the transport
        solution is solved explicitly as in the original MT3D code, and TTSMULT is always set to 1.0 regardless of the
        user-specified input. Note that for the particle tracking based solution options and the 3rd-order TVD scheme,
        TTSMULT does not apply.</div>,
    ttsmax: <div>Maximum transport stepsize allowed when transport stepsize multiplier TTSMULT > 1.0. Setting TTSMAX = 0
        imposes no maximum limit.</div>,
    // DSP
    al: <div>Longitudinal dispersivity for every cell of the model grid (unit: L).</div>,
    trpt: <div>1D real array defining the ratio of the horizontal transverse dispersivity to the longitudinal
        dispersivity. Each value in the array corresponds to one model layer. Some recent field studies suggest
        that TRPT is generally not greater than 0.1.</div>,
    trpv: <div>Ratio of the vertical transverse dispersivity to the longitudinal dispersivity. Each value
        in the array corresponds to one model layer. Some recent field studies suggest that TRPT is generally not
        greater than 0.01. Set TRPV equal to TRPT to use the standard isotropic dispersion model. Otherwise, the
        modified isotropic dispersion model is used.</div>,
    dmcoef: <div>Effective molecular diffusion coefficient (unit: L^2T^-1). Set DMCOEF = 0 if the effect of molecular
        diffusion is considered unimportant. Each value in the array corresponds to one model layer.</div>,
    // GCG
    mxiter: <div>Maximum number of outer iterations. It should be set to an integer greater than one only when a
        nonlinear sorption isotherm is included in simulation.</div>,

    isolve: <div>Type of preconditioners to be used with the Lanczos/ORTHOMIN acceleration scheme.
        <ul>
            <li><i>ISOLVE</i> = 1 Jacobi</li>
            <li><i>ISOLVE</i> = 2 SSOR</li>
            <li><i>ISOLVE</i> = 3 Modified Incomplete Cholesky (MIC usually converges faster, but it needs significantly
                more memory)

                efficient).

    </div>,
    accl: <div>Relaxation factor for the SSOR option. A value of 1.0 is generally adequate.</div>,
    cclose: <div>Convergence criterion in terms of relative concentration. A real value between 10^-4 and 10^-6 is
        generally adequate.</div>,
    iprgcg: <div>Interval for printing the maximum concentration changes of each iteration. Set IPRGCG to 0 as default
        for printing at the end of each stress period.</div>
